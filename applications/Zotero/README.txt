# Zotero Item URI

Code from: https://zoteromusings.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/zotero-item-uris-from-client/

1. Move "Item URI.js" to the "translator" directory in your Zotero data folder "~/Zotero"
2. Restart Firefox/Zotero
3. In the Zotero Preferences go to the “Export” and set the Default Output Format to “Item URI” (this will be towards the bottom of the list)

You can now take advantage of Zotero’s quick copy functionality and drag&drop links from the item in your client right into an email or a blogpost
